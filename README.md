# ProjecTrack

ProjecTrack is a mobile application, built using PWA, designed to serve as an academic project management tool within a single college. Its primary function is to facilitate student group formation, streamline the project proposal and approval process with supervising teachers, and manage ongoing project collaboration.

This repository contains the source code for ProjecTrack, divided into:
- `/frontend`: The React-based PWA client.
- `/backend`: The Node.js with Express.js API server.
