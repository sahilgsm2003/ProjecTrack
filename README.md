# ProjecTrack

ProjecTrack is a mobile-first Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to serve as an academic project management tool within a single college. Its primary function is to facilitate student group formation, streamline the project proposal and approval process with supervising teachers, and manage ongoing project collaboration. The application provides dedicated interfaces for students (within their groups) and teachers, enabling efficient project monitoring, meeting scheduling, progress updates, and feedback exchange in a group context.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

-   `/frontend`: Contains the React (Vite) PWA.
-   `/backend`: Contains the Node.js (Express.js) API server.
